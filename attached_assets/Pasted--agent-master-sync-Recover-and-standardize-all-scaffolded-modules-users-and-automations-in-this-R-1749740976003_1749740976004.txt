/agent:master_sync

Recover and standardize all scaffolded modules, users, and automations in this Replit dashboard.

☑ Restore Watson, Nexus, Admin, Master Control, and subclassed intelligence systems  
☑ Recover all user accounts with previous action history and link to current flow state

Activate simulation + diagnostic engine:
- Replay all user behavior patterns, simulate full click-throughs
- Auto-debug and patch on error, then simulate again to verify corrected state

💥 TERMINATE any workflow loops or render states blocking the fresh rebuild

✅ ENFORCE REAL-TIME FRONTEND VISUALIZATION:
- All backend fixes must render immediately in the live UI preview
- Show visual updates for layout, login, dashboard, metrics, routing

📦 STRUCTURE & STANDARDIZE:
- Bucket modules logically: auth, control, trading, analytics, AI, settings
- Ensure all pages route cleanly with mobile responsiveness and no exposed credentials
- Align theming and structure to Kaizen-DWC UI/UX spec

📡 ACTIVATE QUANTUM PREDICTIVE INTERFACE (QPI):
- Use QPI scores to prioritize debug and enhance cycles
- Attach QPI to dashboard state views (login, AI core, trader panels)

🔁 CONTINUOUS BACKGROUND VALIDATION:
- Recheck all modules every 60 seconds for integrity
- Auto-patch any broken UI/API module live without reload

🧠 ROLE-AWARE RENDERING:
- Adjust dashboards dynamically per user fingerprint (admin, trader, dev)
- Minimize unnecessary modules per role

🛰️ MODULE INTELLIGENCE HOOKS:
- Show live `status`, `QPI`, `logs` per module in the UI
- Allow module-click to test and refresh in-place

📤 SNAPSHOT EXPORT:
- Generate `system_snapshot.json` with health, uptime, version, errors
- Sync result to goal_tracker.json and DWC engine registry

⚔️ FAILSAFE:
- If failure persists, fallback to `/agent:rollback` checkpoint automatically

🧩 INJECT ACTION CANVAS:
- Append custom agent terminal and buttons for `/agent:` triggers
- Let users fix or extend modules from the dashboard UI

🎯 Final Result: Fully recovered, structured, navigable, mobile-ready dashboard, simulated and validated end-to-end, with intelligent visibility and correction built-in.
