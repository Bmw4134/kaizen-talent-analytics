This project is part of my application for the Netflix Analyst, Talent Analytics (Machine Learning) role. It demonstrates my ability to architect a modular, extensible, and ML-ready system for predictive hiring analytics, including talent funnel modeling, sourcing analysis, and candidate forecasting.

## Overview

The `kaizen_talent_analytics` system is designed as a self-evolving, modular Python package that integrates machine learning models and analytics components to support talent acquisition and retention strategies.

### Key Components

- **Fingerprint Engine**: Generates unique fingerprints for prompts.
- **Diff Tracker**: Logs differences between outputs for audit and analysis.
- **Goal Tracker**: Manages goals related to talent analytics workflows.
- **Session Audit**: Logs session activities for traceability.
- **Visual Loop Composer**: Parses markdown to build prompt flow graphs.
- **Predictive Models**: Abstract base and specific models for retention, time to hire, and flight risk.
- **Connectors**: Includes an ATS adapter to ingest applicant tracking system event data.

## Extensibility

This system is designed for easy integration into the existing `nexus-UF` dashboard framework and can be extended with proprietary logic, additional models, and UI components.

## Example Usage

See the example workflow in [`examples/sample_workflow.py`](examples/sample_workflow.py) for a demonstration of how to use the fingerprint engine and predictive models.

# Kaizen Talent Analytics - Standalone

This is the standalone version of the Kaizen Talent Analytics project, separated from the Nexus-UF repository for demonstration purposes.

It is designed as a modular Python package integrating machine learning models and analytics components to support talent acquisition and retention strategies.

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running

This project currently has a minimal entry point:

```
python3 main.py
```

You can extend this with your own scripts or integrate into your applications.

## Contents

- `kaizen_talent_analytics/`: Core package modules and components.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
- `main.py`: Minimal entry point.

## Notes

This project is prepared for submission to Netflix as a demonstration of capabilities.
